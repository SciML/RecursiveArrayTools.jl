This wrapper over such data structures allows one to lazily act like it's a higher-dimensional vector, and easily convert it to different forms. The indexing structure is:\n\nA.u[i] # Returns the ith array in the vector of arrays\nA[j, i] # Returns the jth component in the ith array\nA[j1, ..., jN, i] # Returns the (j1,...,jN) component of the ith array\n\nwhich presents itself as a column-major matrix with the columns being the arrays from the vector. The AbstractArray interface is implemented, giving access to copy, push, append!, etc. functions, which act appropriately. Points to note are:\n\nThe length is the number of vectors, or length(A.u) where u is the vector of arrays.\nIteration follows the linear index and goes over the vectors\n\nAdditionally, the convert(Array,VA::AbstractVectorOfArray) function is provided, which transforms the VectorOfArray into a matrix/tensor. Also, vecarr_to_vectors(VA::AbstractVectorOfArray) returns a vector of the series for each component, that is, A[i,:] for each i. A plot recipe is provided, which plots the A[i,:] series.\n\nThere is also support for VectorOfArray constructed from multi-dimensional arrays\n\nVectorOfArray(u::AbstractArray{AT}) where {T, N, AT <: AbstractArray{T, N}}\n\nwhere IndexStyle(typeof(u)) isa IndexLinear.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"array_types/#RecursiveArrayTools.DiffEqArray","page":"Recursive Array Types","title":"RecursiveArrayTools.DiffEqArray","text":"DiffEqArray(u::AbstractVector, t::AbstractVector)\n\nThis is a VectorOfArray, which stores A.t that matches A.u.

These index like a single array, but each subarray may have a different type. However, broadcast is overloaded to loop in an efficient manner, meaning that A .+= 2.+B is type-stable in its computations, even if A.x[i] and A.x[j] do not match types. A full array interface is included for completeness, which allows this array type to be used in place of a standard array where such a type stable broadcast may be needed. One example is in heterogeneous differential equations for DifferentialEquations.jl.\n\nAn ArrayPartition acts like a single array. A[i] indexes through the first array, then the second, etc., all linearly. But A.x is where the arrays are stored. Thus, for:\n\nusing RecursiveArrayTools\nA = ArrayPartition(y, z)\n\nwe would have A.x[1]==y and A.x[2]==z.
